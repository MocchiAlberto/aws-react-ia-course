# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

To run the code in local host after cloning the repository by:

git clone https://github.com/MocchiAlberto/aws-react-ia-course

Use the following command:

- cd aws-react-ia-course
- npm install
- npm run dev

Now you can access to the webapp at: http://localhost:5173/
